/**
 * Business model templates - task 25.
 *
 * Three templates defined in code with stable string identifiers and a
 * schema version. MVP: hardcoded in code per the spec (§6, "Template Format
 * (V2: extensible)"). V2: standardised format (.md + YAML frontmatter) for
 * community contribution.
 *
 * [impl] Templates are code-only, not database rows. Stable identifier
 * ("preview_free" | "freemium" | "time_limited_trial") and a schemaVersion
 * field are provided so a later database-backed form can migrate cleanly
 * (identifier becomes the primary key; schemaVersion allows format evolution).
 *
 * [impl] Applying a template writes settings.lifecycle, settings.throttle,
 * settings.brain_context, and tenants.business_model. The template's
 * suggested_flows are created as draft flows (not compiled). See the apply
 * endpoint for the full contract.
 *
 * [impl] Brain context: stored at the tenant level in settings.brain_context
 * (no new column - settings is already a JSONB field). It is product-level
 * context, so duplicating it into every flow prompt_source would make it
 * uneditable in one place. The context assembler injects it into the
 * decide/draft prompts as the PRODUCT CONTEXT section (context-flow.ts);
 * the operator edits it via PATCH /v1/settings/tenant.
 *
 * [impl] Throttle fields sourced from the spec:
 *   max_emails_per_user_per_week and min_interval_between_emails_hours.
 *   The spec only defines these two per template. All other ThrottleConfig
 *   fields (send_window_*, batch_size_per_tick, drain_interval_minutes,
 *   critical_bypass_throttle) are left as defaults from the resolver.
 *
 * [impl] Lifecycle fields sourced from the spec:
 *   activation_window_days, natural_frequency_days, at_risk_missed_intervals,
 *   dormant_days, churned_days. The spec does not define
 *   engagement_depth_window_days or power_user_percentile for templates;
 *   these are left as defaults from the resolver.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/core is mirrored).
