/**
 * Library flows: pre-built flows with hand-authored compiled plans and templates.
 *
 * These ship with Claros and can be installed by a self-hoster to get
 * immediate value without configuring an LLM. The flows use template_ref
 * so every email is rendered deterministically from pre-authored content.
 *
 * Business model: SaaS product onboarding.
 * Chosen because it is the universal first use case for any self-hoster
 * evaluating a lifecycle email engine, and because it demonstrates the
 * full event-to-email pipeline with a single track event (signed_up).
 *
 * Set: Welcome flow (3 emails over 3 days)
 *   Step 1: Immediate welcome (delay: 0m, template: welcome)
 *   Step 2: Getting started guide (delay: 1d, template: getting-started)
 *   Step 3: Check-in (delay: 3d, template: check-in)
 *
 * Exit condition: if the contact fires "activated" event, exit the flow
 * (they have already gotten value from the product and do not need more
 * onboarding nudges).
 *
 * Cost to user: 1 flow, 3 emails per contact, over 3 days.
 * A contact who activates early receives fewer (exit condition fires).
 * No contact receives more than 3 emails from this flow total.
 *
 * Activation: installing and activating are separate acts. The install
 * endpoint creates the templates and flow in "draft" status. The user
 * must explicitly set the flow to "active" to start enrollment.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/core is mirrored).

<p>Hi {{contact.first_name|there}},</p>

<p>Most people who get value from {{tenant.name}} do three things in their first week:</p>

<ol>
<li>Connect their data source (takes about 2 minutes)</li>
<li>Set up their first automation</li>
<li>Send a test message to themselves</li>
</ol>

<p>That third one is the moment it clicks. You see the email arrive and think: "right, this is going to save me a lot of time."</p>

<p>If you have already done all three, ignore this email - you are ahead of the curve. If not, the first one takes two minutes and unlocks everything else.</p>

<p>Questions? Just reply.</p>

<p>Hi {{contact.first_name|there}},</p>

<p>You signed up a few days ago and I wanted to check in. Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Did you get {{tenant.name}} doing what you needed?</li>
<li>Is there anything blocking you?</li>
</ol>

<p>If the answer to #1 is yes, great - you will not hear from me again unless something useful comes up. If the answer to #2 is anything other than "no," reply and tell me what is in the way. I will either fix it or point you to someone who can.</p>

<p>No pressure either way. Just want to make sure you are not stuck.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>The {{tenant.name}} team</p>
