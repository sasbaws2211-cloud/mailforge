/**
 * @claros/scheduler - Registers cron schedules on the pg-boss instance.
 *
 * The scheduler role's only job is to call boss.schedule() for each recurring
 * job. It does NOT call boss.work(). Workers (startWorker) own the handler
 * side; the scheduler owns the trigger side.
 *
 * Depends on @claros/core (queue names) and pg-boss (PgBoss type).
 * Does NOT depend on @claros/worker. The queue name string is the only
 * interface between scheduler and worker at the code level.
 *
 * Pattern: one boss.schedule() call per cron-triggered queue constant.
 * Add a new schedule here in the same commit as the queue name in @claros/core
 * and the handler in @claros/worker.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/scheduler is mirrored).
