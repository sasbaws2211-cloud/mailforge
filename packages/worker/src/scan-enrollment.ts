/**
 * Scan phase 2: flow enrollment for lifecycle-transition triggers.
 *
 * Called AFTER phaseTimeTransitions (phase 1), which provides the list of
 * transitions that just fired. For each transition, finds active flows whose
 * trigger_config matches {from, to}, then runs the enrollment sequence.
 *
 * This phase does NOT paginate the contact table. Its input is bounded by
 * the number of transitions phase 1 applied (typically O(10s) per scan run).
 * No checkpoint is needed.
 *
 * Segment-triggered flows are skipped with a warning (unsupported in MVP).
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/worker is mirrored).
