 * The LogTransportAdapter (for tests only) lives in packages/worker/tests/.
 * It is structurally impossible to use in production: it is never registered
 * in any resolver, and cannot be imported from src/ without violating the
 * test/src boundary.

 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/worker is mirrored).
