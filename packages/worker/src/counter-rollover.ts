/**
 * Counter rollover worker - rotates engagement event count buckets.
 *
 * Runs every scan tick (15 min) but only actually rolls contacts whose
 * last_counter_reset_at is older than 15 days (or NULL, meaning never reset).
 * The rotation shifts current bucket counts into the previous-bucket column
 * and zeroes the current bucket, giving downstream queries a sliding two-bucket
 * window of event activity without needing expensive COUNT(*) over events.
 *
 * The 15-day bucket width is a fixed constant (not tenant-configurable).
 * Running every tick is cheap: the WHERE clause ensures only eligible contacts
 * are touched, and the UPDATE is a single round-trip regardless of how many
 * contacts qualify.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/worker is mirrored).
