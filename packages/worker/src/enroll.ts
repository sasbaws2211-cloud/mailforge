/**
 * Shared enrollment logic: guards, eviction, and membership insertion.
 *
 * Used by both scan-enrollment.ts (lifecycle-transition triggers) and
 * trigger-check.ts (event triggers). Contains the I/O-bearing enrollment
 * sequence that runs inside a transaction with an advisory lock.
 *
 * The enrollment guard order:
 *   1. Suppression check (contact's email in suppressions table)
 *   2. Class-based concurrency (nurture: one active at a time, with priority eviction)
 *   3. Re-entry policy check
 *   4. INSERT with ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (race backstop)
 *
 * Concurrency: the entire enrollment sequence for a contact is serialized
 * via pg_advisory_xact_lock (transaction-scoped, auto-released on crash).
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/worker is mirrored).
