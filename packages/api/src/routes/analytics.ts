/**
 * Analytics routes (Lifecycle Overview and Analytics screens).
 *
 * All routes require session-cookie authentication (dashboard operator scope).
 * They are registered under the /v1 prefix inside the authenticated scope in
 * app.ts, which enforces request.tenant !== null before any route handler runs.
 *
 * Endpoints:
 *   GET /v1/analytics/lifecycle       state distribution (with depth matrix) + movement
 *   GET /v1/analytics/sending         sending performance over time and per flow
 *   GET /v1/analytics/retention-grid  tenure x recency cell counts (retention grid)
 *   GET /v1/analytics/retention-grid/:tenure/:recency/contacts  contacts in a cell
 *   GET /v1/analytics/retention-grid/:tenure/:recency/trend     daily cell population
 *
 * Both take ?days=<1..90> (default 30). Aggregation happens in Postgres;
 * no rows are shipped to the client for counting.
 *
 * What the data supports, honestly:
 *   - Distribution is CURRENT state only (contacts.lifecycle_state). There
 *     are no historical snapshots, so "distribution over time" cannot be
 *     served and is not approximated here.
 *   - Movement comes from lifecycle_transitions, which records every state
 *     change. Per-day movement, per-state entries/exits, and state-to-state
 *     edges are all exact.
 *   - Retention-grid cell counts are current state; the per-cell trend comes
 *     from retention_grid_snapshots, written once per UTC day by the
 *     grid-snapshot worker. History starts the day the job first runs; it is
 *     not backfilled.
 *   - Sends are counted on sent_at IS NOT NULL ("what went out").
 *   - Opens, clicks and bounces: cumulative totals come from the advance-only
 *     feedback column. Per-day TRENDS now come from the message_events table
 *     (added in migration 0021), which records timestamped delivery events.
 *     The trends only cover messages that have event rows - older messages
 *     predating the table have no events and are not included in trends.
 *
 * Query cost against today's indexes:
 *   - distribution: uses idx_contacts_tenant_state (tenant_id,
 *     lifecycle_state). Cheap.
 *   - movement: uses idx_transitions_tenant_time (tenant_id,
 *     transitioned_at), added in migration 0018.
 *   - sending: uses idx_messages_tenant_sent (tenant_id, sent_at)
 *     WHERE sent_at IS NOT NULL, added in migration 0018.
 *   - engagement trends: uses idx_message_events_tenant_type_day
 *     (tenant_id, event_type, occurred_at).
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/api is mirrored).
