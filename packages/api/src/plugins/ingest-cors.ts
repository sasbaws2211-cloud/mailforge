/**
 * CORS handling for the ingestion scope.
 *
 * Why this configuration is safe:
 * - Ingestion authenticates with a token in the request (Authorization header
 *   or body field), never with cookies. Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is
 *   never emitted, so no ambient browser authority (session cookies) can be
 *   attached cross-origin. The session-cookie dashboard scope is entirely
 *   unaffected: these headers exist only inside the /v1/track + /v1/identify
 *   encapsulated scope.
 * - The worst case a permissive ACAO enables here is "a page the user visits
 *   can write events with a key it already possesses." That is the defined
 *   capability of a publishable key. No key-authenticated endpoint can read
 *   tenant data, so there is nothing to exfiltrate.
 *
 * Preflight policy: OPTIONS is answered permissively (echo Origin, allow
 * POST + authorization/content-type headers) because a preflight carries no
 * key and therefore cannot be validated against a key's origin allowlist.
 * Enforcement happens on the actual request: the auth hook rejects
 * disallowed origins with 403 and no ACAO header, so the browser blocks it.
 *
 * Simple-request design: the browser snippet posts with
 * Content-Type: text/plain (a CORS-safelisted value) and the key in the
 * body, so the common case is a simple request with no preflight at all and
 * works through navigator.sendBeacon on page unload. The text/plain parser
 * registered here (scope-local) parses the body as JSON. The
 * Authorization-header + application/json path remains fully supported for
 * server-side clients; it simply costs one preflight per origin.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/api is mirrored).
