/**
 * Role enforcement plugin for the authenticated /v1 scope.
 *
 * Design:
 *   Every route registered inside the /v1 scope MUST declare its minimum
 *   required role via `config: { minRole: "member" | "owner" }`. If a route
 *   is registered without this declaration, the app REFUSES TO START with a
 *   clear error naming the offending route.
 *
 *   This inverts the usual pattern (opt-in restriction) to make omission
 *   impossible rather than safe. Most routes will declare "member", which is
 *   fine - the property we enforce is that the developer made a conscious
 *   choice.
 *
 * Enforcement layers:
 *   1. onRoute hook (boot time): rejects routes without config.minRole.
 *   2. preHandler hook (request time): checks request.tenant.userRole
 *      against the declared minRole and returns 403 if insufficient.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (packages/api is mirrored).
