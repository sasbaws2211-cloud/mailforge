/**
 * Vite configuration for the Claros dashboard SPA.
 *
 * Dev server proxy: forwards API calls to the Fastify backend so the
 * browser always operates on a single origin (no CORS needed).
 * Target defaults to http://localhost:3000, overridable via
 * VITE_API_URL environment variable (set in a .env.local file).
 *
 * Test configuration is included here (not in a separate vitest.config.ts)
 * so that the path alias "@/*" is declared exactly once and shared between
 * the build and the test runner. Two config files mean two alias declarations,
 * which creates a class of bug where the build resolves but tests do not.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (apps/dashboard is mirrored).
