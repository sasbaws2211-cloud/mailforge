/**
 * Badge component.
 *
 * Status is signalled by a small dot plus tinted text on a soft surface.
 * Filled semantic blocks (the old traffic-light pills) are gone: in a dense
 * table they shout over the content, and every cell competing for attention
 * means no cell gets it.
 *
 * Tones and their meaning:
 *   accent  - brand emphasis, rare (key filter, current state of note)
 *   neutral - inactive but ordinary (draft)
 *   muted   - inactive and de-emphasized (archived, not compiled)
 *   success - working as intended (active, ready)
 *   warning - needs attention or in progress (paused, pending)
 *   danger  - broken (failed)
 *
 * The pulse prop animates the dot (e.g. compile pending). It animates
 * opacity only and is disabled by prefers-reduced-motion.
 *
 * Mirror side: PUBLIC (apps/dashboard is mirrored).
